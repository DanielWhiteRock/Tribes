Use GamiPress points types as a payment gateway for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Points Gateway gives you the ability to use GamiPress registered points type as a payment gateway.

In just a few minutes, your users will be able to complete any purchase by expending an amount of points.
